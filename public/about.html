<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/Natsumi Karlsson.jpg" width="150">
<p>I'm Natsumi Karlsson. I have lived in Sweden for three years, and I moved back to Japan and have lived in Chiba since last October. <br/>
  My husband is from Sweden, and he speaks Swedish, English and Japanese well, so we usually comunicate both in Japanese and in English, and I can also comunicate with his parents in Swedish too! <br/>
  Now, I'm looking for some job which I can get IT skill or use and brush up my English skill. <br/>
  I just started learning how to code, and it's a lot of fun. I will keep doing this for making my own website in the future!
